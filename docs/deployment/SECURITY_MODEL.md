# Security Framework

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive security analysis and implementation recommendations.

## 1. Threat Model
- **Actors and Motivations**
  - Threat actor profiles
  - Motivation analysis
  - Capability assessment
  - Target assets
  - Logging and monitoring implementation to detect threat actors

- **Attack Vectors**
  - Network-based attack vectors
  - Client-side vulnerabilities
  - Server-side vulnerabilities
  - Edge-specific attack surfaces
  - API hardening against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks

- **Educational Context Threats**
  - Student data exposure risks
  - Content safety concerns
  - Educational integrity threats
  - Classroom disruption scenarios
  - Implementing encryption and strict access control for student data

- **Resource Constraint Implications**
  - Security vs. performance tradeoffs
  - Edge-specific security challenges
  - Offline operation security concerns
  - Resource limitation impacts
  - Strengthening offline authentication and secure local storage

## 2. Vulnerability Assessment
- **Frontend Vulnerabilities**
  - Input validation issues (Ensure strict frontend & backend validation)
  - Client-side security controls (Add CSP policies to mitigate XSS)
  - State management vulnerabilities
  - Offline data exposure risks (Implement encrypted local storage)

- **Backend Vulnerabilities**
  - API security concerns (Enforce rate limiting and token-based authentication)
  - Authentication weaknesses (Ensure short token expiration and secure storage)
  - Authorization gaps (Strict RBAC and permission enforcement on all endpoints)
  - Data handling vulnerabilities (Ensure encryption at rest and in transit)

- **Prompt Engineering Vulnerabilities**
  - Prompt injection risks (Sanitize LLM-based inputs and apply strict constraints)
  - Template security issues (Use validated templates with secure variable handling)
  - Constraint bypass possibilities (Implement AI-based content filtering)
  - Content filtering evasion (Apply multi-stage validation)

- **Edge-Specific Vulnerabilities**
  - Offline authentication weaknesses (Ensure secure token storage and re-authentication policies)
  - Local storage security concerns (Enforce storage encryption and controlled access)
  - Sync mechanism vulnerabilities (Use HMAC or hash-based integrity checks for data verification)
  - Physical access risks

## 3. Security Controls
- **Authentication Framework**
  - Authentication mechanism design (Session tokens or JWTs with short expiration)
  - Credential management (Secure storage and rotation of credentials)
  - Session handling (Enforce secure session expiration policies)
  - Multi-factor considerations (Implement MFA for admin users)

- **Authorization System**
  - Permission model design (Strict RBAC enforcement (Ensure RBAC functions offline by securely caching permission data and synchronizing updates when online))
  - Role-based access control (Assign granular permissions per API route)
  - Context-based authorization (Apply IP-based restrictions for critical operations)
  - Least privilege implementation

- **Data Protection**
  - Encryption strategy (Ensure end-to-end encryption for sensitive data)
  - Personal data handling (Implement data minimization policies)
  - Data minimization approach
  - Secure storage implementation

- **Input/Output Validation**
  - Validation framework design (Ensure strict server-side validation)
  - Sanitization approach (Use whitelisting over blacklisting)
  - Error handling security (Prevent leakage of system internals in error messages)
  - Content filtering implementation

## 4. Secure Prompting Framework
- **Template Security**
  - Secure template design patterns
  - Variable handling security
  - Constraint implementation (Ensure predefined templates with validation)
  - Versioning security

- **Multi-Stage Validation Security**
  - Validation sequence security
  - Bypass prevention
  - Failure handling security
  - Error reporting security

- **Content Safety Enforcement**
  - Content filtering mechanisms (Apply AI-based content filtering (For offline operation, ensure content filtering works locally with pre-downloaded models or rule sets to maintain security without requiring an internet connection))
  - Age-appropriate content controls
  - Educational appropriateness validation
  - Override mechanism security

## 5. Edge Security Implementation
- **Offline Authentication**
  - Secure credential storage (Ensure encrypted local storage for credentials (Consider using hardware-backed secure storage where available, and ensure that encryption keys are not exposed in offline mode))
  - Offline token validation (Re-authenticate users when back online (Consider how authentication should gracefully handle prolonged offline periods and securely refresh credentials upon reconnection))
  - Session expiration handling
  - Privilege escalation prevention

- **Local Data Security**
  - Encryption implementation
  - Secure storage mechanisms
  - Permission enforcement
  - Secure deletion

- **Synchronization Security**
  - Secure sync protocols
  - Data integrity validation (Use hash-based integrity checks for sync operations (Ensure that offline data modifications are tracked and validated before syncing back online to prevent tampering))
  - Conflict resolution security
  - Transport security

## 6. Security Recommendations
- **Critical Mitigations**
  - Enforce strict API authentication & authorization (RBAC + JWT security best practices)
  - Harden input validation to prevent XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection
  - Encrypt all stored and transmitted sensitive data
  - Secure prompt inputs (if using LLMs) to avoid prompt injection
  - Implement MFA for admin accounts

- **Implementation Roadmap**
  - Security control sequencing
  - Dependency management
  - Incremental security improvement
  - Verification strategy

- **Security Testing Framework**
  - Test case design
  - Coverage requirements
  - Testing methodology
  - Acceptance criteria
