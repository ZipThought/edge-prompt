## Implementation Path

The documentation is being developed in phases:

1. **Foundation Documents** - Establish core principles and architecture
2. **Specification Documents** - Define detailed component behaviors
3. **Implementation Documents** - Provide specific implementation guidance
4. **Integration Documents** - Specify interactions between components
5. **Deployment Documents** - Detail operational considerations

## Meta-Documentation

This documentation itself is designed to be a living specification that evolves with the system. The documentation is structured to be:

- **Comprehensive**: Complete enough to rebuild the system from scratch
- **MECE**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive to avoid ambiguity
- **Precise**: Using exact terminology and clear relationships
- **AI-Augmentation Ready**: Optimized for AI-augmented development
- **Domain-Aware**: Preserving educational terminology and concepts
