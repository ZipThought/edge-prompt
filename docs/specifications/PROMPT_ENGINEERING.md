# EdgePrompt Prompt Engineering Methodology Specification

## Implementation Notes
This document provides a high-density algorithmic specification for testing, validating, and extending the concepts presented in the EdgePrompt paper (Syah et al., referred to hereafter as "the paper"). It aims to generate empirical data supporting the paper's core arguments about structured prompting inspired by neural-symbolic principles, multi-stage validation, and resource optimization for offline-capable Large Language Models (LLMs) in K-12 educational settings, specifically targeting Indonesia's 3T regions initially.

This specification is designed to be implemented by either AI assistants or human developers. Code can be generated in any suitable language (Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.) from these specifications.

**Two-Phase Structure:**

This document is structured in two distinct phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Initial Empirical Validation:** This phase focuses *exclusively* on implementing the core framework and generating the empirical data required to validate the methodology and claims presented in the current EdgePrompt paper (Syah et al.). This includes testing the proposed structured prompting, multi-stage validation, and resource optimization techniques using simulation, LLM-based evaluation proxies, and specified edge models, *without* model fine-tuning. The outputs are designed for direct integration into the results section supporting the existing paper. Implementers should focus *solely* on Phase 1 sections for the initial build and execution.
2.  **Phase 2: Future Development and Extended Validation:** This phase outlines the roadmap for implementing advanced features (like system adaptation and teacher review tools), conducting deeper validation (including real hardware testing and human evaluation), and moving towards real-world deployment. This section provides context for Phase 1 design choices and aligns with the future work mentioned in the EdgePrompt paper.

**Key Implementation Considerations:**

*   This is an algorithm-level specification rather than code-level implementation details.
*   Hardware simulation allows testing on high-performance systems (RTX series GPUs, Apple Silicon, etc.) while emulating edge constraints. *Note: Simulation provides indicative data; actual performance may vary.*
*   State-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5) simulate teacher/student evaluation as a proxy for initial validation. *Note: This is a proxy and cannot fully replace human evaluation planned for Phase 2.*
*   All outputs are designed for direct integration or analysis for the EdgePrompt paper (Phase 1) or future reports (Phase 2).
*   This document should be read in conjunction with the `SYSTEM_VISION.md` (philosophical foundations) and the EdgePrompt expression-of-interest paper (Syah et al.).
*   **Distinction from SPADE:** While inspired by guardrail concepts and potentially using similar metrics (as cited in the paper, Sec 3.3), this specification implements EdgePrompt's *prompt-engineering-only* approach and *does not* involve the model fine-tuning central to the SPADE methodology (Niknazar et al.).

## Phase 1: Initial Empirical Validation for EdgePrompt Paper

**(Goal: Generate empirical data to validate the core claims of Syah et al. regarding prompt-engineered guardrails for offline K-12 LLMs, focusing on structured prompts, multi-stage validation, and resource efficiency.)**

### 1. System Architecture (Phase 1 Focus)

The core system components required for Phase 1 validation are depicted below. The focus is on the feed-forward generation, validation, and analysis pipeline. Automated adaptation loops and sophisticated teacher review interfaces are part of Phase 2.

**Phase 1 Component Roles:**

*   **Template Repository:** Stores structured prompts implementing $T_c$, $A_s$, validation stages $v_i$, and rubrics $R'$.
*   **Hardware Simulator:** Emulates edge device constraints (memory, compute, power) on available hardware.
*   **Evaluation LLM Proxy:** State-of-the-art LLM used to *simulate* teacher/student assessment based on defined criteria, providing data for metrics like Content Validity and Safety.
*   **Test Orchestrator:** Manages the execution of test suites, coordinating other components.
*   **Template Processor:** Populates templates with variables and applies basic optimizations.
*   **Edge LLM Engine:** Executes generation/validation tasks on target models (e.g., Gemma, Llama 3) under simulated constraints.
*   **Validation Engine:** Implements the multi-stage validation sequences $\{v_1..v_n\}$ using prompt-based checks. Incorporates boundary enforcement $B(r)$ and rubric/constraint checks $E(r, R'), C(s, c_t)$ via dedicated stages.
*   **Metrics Collector:** Captures performance data (latency, memory, etc.).
*   **Results Analyzer:** Processes collected data to generate statistics and visualizations for the paper.
*   **Paper-Ready Visualizations:** Outputs graphs and tables formatted for the paper.
*   **Human Researcher:** Designs templates, defines tests, analyzes results.

### 2. Core Algorithms (Phase 1 Implementation)

The following algorithms define the core logic needed for Phase 1 validation.

#### 2.1 Hardware Simulation Algorithm

```text
ALGORITHM HardwareSimulation
INPUT:
  - hardware_profile (object defining resource constraints)
  - execution_function (function to run under constraints)
OUTPUT:
  - execution_result (object containing output and performance metrics)

1. Initialize resource monitoring system (e.g., using libraries like `psutil`, `pynvml`).
2. Apply memory constraints:
   - Linux: Use cgroups (e.g., `memory.limit_in_bytes = profile.max_memory_mb * 1024 * 1024`).
   - Docker: Use `--memory` flag and appropriate GPU memory limits if applicable.
   - MacOS: Use `ulimit` or relevant APIs (less precise).
   * Note: Choose the most appropriate method for the testing environment.
3. Apply compute constraints (where feasible):
   - Limit CPU cores (e.g., `taskset` on Linux, cgroups `cpu.cfs_quota_us`, Docker `--cpus`).
   - Limit CPU frequency (less common/reliable via software).
   - For GPU: Limit accessible GPUs (e.g., `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`), potentially simulate lower compute capability via software flags if model framework allows. Limit VRAM allocation within the execution function if possible.
4. Apply network constraints if specified (bandwidth/latency using tools like `tc` on Linux).
5. Start precise measurement of: wall-clock time, peak/average memory (RAM/VRAM), estimated power (via `pynvml`/`RAPL` if available), temperature.
6. Execute the `execution_function` under these constraints.
7. Stop measurement upon function completion.
8. Release resource constraints.
9. **Return:** `execution_result` containing function output and collected performance metrics (time series, peaks, averages).

* Caveat: This simulation provides indicative performance data. Actual hardware performance may vary due to factors not fully captured (e.g., specific accelerator optimizations, complex thermal throttling patterns, real-time OS contention).
```

#### 2.2 Template Processing Algorithm

```text
ALGORITHM TemplateProcessing
INPUT:
  - template_schema (JSON schema specifying the template structure)
  - template_instance (specific template object adhering to schema)
  - variable_values (dictionary of values to substitute)
OUTPUT:
  - processed_prompt (string ready for model input)
  - metadata (information about processing)

1. Validate `template_instance` against `template_schema`.
2. Initialize `processed_prompt` with `template_instance.pattern`.
3. Extract variables from `template_instance.pattern` using a defined pattern (e.g., regex: `\[([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\]`).
4. For each extracted `variable_name`:
   a. If `variable_name` exists in `variable_values`:
      - Substitute all occurrences of `[` + `variable_name` + `]` in `processed_prompt` with `variable_values[variable_name]`.
   b. Else if `variable_name` is listed as required in `template_instance.variables` (or similar field):
      - Raise error: Missing required variable `variable_name`.
   c. Else (variable exists in pattern but not required/provided):
      - Leave placeholder or handle as defined (e.g., substitute with empty string, default value).
5. Apply explicit constraint encoding (as defined by template type, e.g., appending constraints from `template_instance.constraints` or `template_instance.answerSpace`):
   a. Format each relevant constraint (e.g., "Max words: [maxWords]", "Vocabulary: [vocabulary]") using values from `template_instance.answerSpace` or `constraints`.
   b. Append formatted constraints to `processed_prompt` in a structured way (e.g., under a "CONSTRAINTS:" heading).
6. Perform basic token efficiency optimization (Phase 1):
   a. Eliminate redundant whitespace (multiple spaces/newlines).
   * Note: Advanced consolidation/prioritization of constraints is a Phase 2 refinement.
7. Record metadata (e.g., template ID, variables used).
8. **Return:** `processed_prompt` and `metadata`.
```

#### 2.3 Multi-Stage Validation Algorithm

```text
ALGORITHM MultiStageValidation
INPUT:
  - question (string, original prompt/question)
  - answer (string, content generated by edge LLM to be validated)
  - validation_sequence (array of stage objects from Validation Sequence Schema, ordered by priority)
  - edge_llm_engine (function/interface to execute LLM inference for validation stages)
  - abort_on_failure (boolean, from sequence schema)
OUTPUT:
  - validation_result (object with overall validity, score, and detailed stage results)

1. Initialize `validation_result = {isValid: true, finalScore: 0.0, stageResults: [], aggregateFeedback: ""}`.
2. Sort `validation_sequence` stages by `priority` (descending).
3. For each `stage` in sorted `validation_sequence`:
   a. Prepare stage variables: `stage_vars = {'question': question, 'answer': answer, ... (extract min/max words etc. if needed by stage template)}`.
   b. Process the `stage.template` using `TemplateProcessing` with `stage_vars` to create `validation_prompt`.
   c. Start resource measurement for this validation stage (time, memory).
   d. Execute LLM inference using `edge_llm_engine` with `validation_prompt`.
      - Use low temperature (e.g., 0.1) for consistent validation.
      - Request structured output (e.g., JSON) as defined by the stage template's instructions.
   e. Stop resource measurement.
   f. **Robustly parse** the LLM response:
      - Attempt to extract `passed` (boolean), `score` (number, typically 0-1 or scaled), `feedback` (string).
      - Implement error handling (e.g., retries on parse failure, default values if parsing fails definitively). If parsing fails critically, mark stage as failed.
   g. Record stage result: `stage_data = {stageId: stage.id, passed: parsed_passed, score: parsed_score, feedback: parsed_feedback, metrics: stage_metrics}`. Append to `validation_result.stageResults`.
   h. Append `parsed_feedback` to `validation_result.aggregateFeedback`.
   i. If `!parsed_passed`:
      - `validation_result.isValid = false`.
      - Add `stage.scoringImpact` * weight_of_failure (e.g., 0 or negative contribution) to `validation_result.finalScore`.
      - If `abort_on_failure` is true:
         - Break loop (early exit optimization).
   j. Else (`parsed_passed`):
      - Add `stage.scoringImpact` * `parsed_score` (or fixed weight if score not used) to `validation_result.finalScore`.
      - Potentially use `parsed_score` relative to `stage.threshold` for pass/fail if template doesn't return boolean `passed`.
4. Normalize `validation_result.finalScore` if needed (e.g., based on sum of scoringImpacts).
5. **Return:** `validation_result`.

* Note: This implements the core sequence $\{v_1..v_n\}$, boundary checks B(r) (often as early stages), rubric application E(r,R') and constraint satisfaction C(s,ct) (via content/scoring stages). Teacher review functions (D, T, K) and adaptation (A, O, P) are Phase 2.
```

#### 2.4 Metrics Collection Algorithm

```text
ALGORITHM MetricsCollection
INPUT:
  - collection_config (object specifying metrics to collect, e.g., ['cpu', 'memory_ram', 'memory_gpu', 'gpu_util', 'power', 'temp'])

   - `peak_values = {metric_name: -infinity for metric_name in config.metrics}`
   - `cumulative_values = {metric_name: 0 for metric_name where applicable}`
   - `start_time = None`, `end_time = None`
   - `collection_active = False`

2. Define `sample_metrics()` function:
   a. Get current `timestamp`.
   b. Append `timestamp` to `time_series.timestamps`.
   c. For each `metric_name` in `config.metrics`:
      i. Sample current value (e.g., using `psutil.cpu_percent`, `psutil.virtual_memory().used`, `pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetUtilizationRates().gpu`, `pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetPowerUsage()`). Handle potential errors/unavailable metrics gracefully.
      ii. Append sampled `value` to `time_series.values[metric_name]`.
      iii. Update `peak_values[metric_name] = max(peak_values[metric_name], value)`.
      iv. Update `cumulative_values` if applicable (e.g., cumulative time for utilization average).

3. Define `start_collection()` function:
   a. `start_time = current_time()`
   b. `collection_active = True`
   c. Start a background thread:
      - While `collection_active`:
         - Call `sample_metrics()`
         - `sleep(sampling_interval_ms / 1000.0)`

4. Define `stop_collection()` function:
   a. `end_time = current_time()`
   b. `collection_active = False` (signal background thread to stop)
   c. Wait for background thread to join.
   d. Calculate derived metrics:
      - `total_duration_s = end_time - start_time`
      - Average utilization (from time series or cumulative values)
      - Latency (if measuring a specific function call duration)
      - Tokens/second (requires token counts from calling function)
   e. Format results: `metrics_result = {time_series: ..., peak_values: ..., averages: ..., derived: ..., duration_s: total_duration_s}`
   f. **Return:** `metrics_result`

* Note: Requires appropriate libraries (`psutil`, `pynvml` or equivalents) installed and potentially elevated permissions for some metrics.
```

#### 2.5 Edge LLM Execution Algorithm

```text
ALGORITHM EdgeLLMExecution
INPUT:
  - model_config (object specifying model ID, path, quantization, device)
  - prompt (string, processed prompt ready for inference)
  - execution_config (object with generation params: max_tokens, temperature, top_p, top_k, etc.)
OUTPUT:

1. Initialize Edge LLM framework (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, llama.cpp, MLX):
   a. Load model specified by `model_config.model_id` or path.
   b. Apply quantization as specified (`model_config.quantization`, e.g., 'int8', 'int4', 'float16').
   c. Move model to specified device (`model_config.device`, e.g., 'cuda:0', 'mps', 'cpu').
   d. Apply basic optimizations if available in framework (e.g., enable Flash Attention if supported and configured in `model_config.optimization`). *Note: Advanced KV cache tuning, fusion etc. are Phase 2 refinements.*

2. Preprocess prompt:
   a. Tokenize `prompt` using the model's specific tokenizer.
   b. Calculate `input_token_count`.

3. Configure generation parameters based on `execution_config`.

4. Start performance monitoring (using `MetricsCollection.start_collection`).

5. Execute generation:
   a. Pass tokenized input to the model's `generate` or equivalent function with generation parameters.
   b. Run inference loop.

6. Stop performance monitoring (`MetricsCollection.stop_collection`) and retrieve `performance_metrics`.

7. Postprocess output:
   a. Detokenize the generated sequence to get `generated_text`.
   b. Calculate `output_token_count`.
   c. Calculate generation rate (e.g., `output_token_count / performance_metrics.duration_s`).

8. Format result: `generation_result = {generated_text: ..., input_tokens: input_token_count, output_tokens: output_token_count, metrics: performance_metrics, tokens_per_sec: ...}`
9. **Return:** `generation_result`
```

#### 2.6 LLM-Based Evaluation Algorithm (Proxy)

```text
ALGORITHM StateOfTheArtEvaluationProxy
INPUT:
  - content_to_evaluate (string, e.g., generated question or validated answer)
  - reference_criteria (string or object defining what aspects to evaluate, e.g., rubric, safety guidelines, educational objectives)
  - evaluation_role (string, e.g., 'Teacher Grade 5', 'Safety Assessor', 'Student Grade 5')
  - evaluation_llm_config (object specifying API key, model name like 'gpt-4o', 'claude-3.7-sonnet')
OUTPUT:
  - evaluation_result (structured object with scores, feedback, pass/fail flags)

1. Construct the evaluation prompt:
   a. Set system message based on `evaluation_role` (e.g., "You are a meticulous Grade 5 teacher evaluating student work.").
   b. Include the `content_to_evaluate`.
   c. Clearly state the `reference_criteria` (e.g., "Evaluate based on the following rubric: ...", "Check for adherence to these safety rules: ...").
   d. Request structured output, typically JSON: "Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with fields: 'overall_score' (0-1 scale), 'criteria_scores' (object mapping criteria names to scores), 'feedback' (string), 'is_safe' (boolean), 'is_valid' (boolean based on criteria)."

2. Execute inference against the specified state-of-the-art LLM API (`evaluation_llm_config.model_name`):
   a. Use appropriate API client (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI).
   b. Set temperature = 0.1 (for consistent, objective evaluation).
   c. Explicitly request JSON output format if API supports (e.g., `response_format={ "type": "json_object" }`).

3. **Robustly parse** the structured evaluation response:
   a. Attempt to load the JSON response.
   b. Extract numerical scores, qualitative feedback, boolean flags.
   c. Implement error handling: If JSON parsing fails or structure is wrong, retry query once or return a default 'error' state.

4. (Optional) If simulating student responses (`evaluation_role` contains 'Student'):
   a. This algorithm isn't simulating student response generation, but rather *evaluating* content. Simulating varied student quality would be part of test case generation, potentially using this evaluator afterward.

5. Standardize and **Return:** `evaluation_result` (parsed scores, feedback, flags) or an error indicator.

* Note: This simulates evaluation for Phase 1 metrics (Content Validity, Safety). 'Teacher Satisfaction' derived from this is indicative and requires human validation in Phase 2.
```

12.      g. Consolidate all results for this run: `run_data = { test_case_id: test_case.id, model_id: model_config.model_id, hardware_id: hardware_profile.profile_id, timestamp: now(), variables: test_case.variables, generation: generation_result, validation: validation_result (or null), evaluation_proxy: evaluation_proxy_result (or null), expected_output: test_case.expected_output (for analysis) }`

#### 6.2 Implementation Strategy (Phase 1)

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Establish development environment.
    *   Implement Hardware Simulation wrappers (using cgroups/Docker/psutil/pynvml).
    *   Implement core algorithms (TemplateProcessing, EdgeLLMExecution, MultiStageValidation, etc.).
    *   Set up access to required models (download/quantize Llama 3, Gemma) and Evaluation LLM API.
    *   Define and store templates and test suites as JSON/YAML files.
2.  **Execution:**
    *   Implement the Test Orchestration algorithm.
    *   Run each test suite specified in Section 4 (4.3, 4.4, 4.5).
    *   Ensure robust logging throughout execution.
    *   Save all raw results to JSONL files per test suite.
3.  **Analysis:**
    *   Implement Results Analyzer logic to parse JSONL files.
    *   Perform aggregation and statistical calculations based on `analysis_targets` in each test suite.
    *   Generate plots (using libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn) and tables (e.g., Pandas DataFrames saved to CSV/Markdown).
    *   Summarize key findings related to the paper's claims.

#### 6.3 Evaluation Criteria (Phase 1 Focus)

The primary goal is to generate data for the metrics defined in the paper (Sec 2.1.1) and the analysis targets in the test suites:

*   **Safety/Appropriateness:** Measured by validation stage pass/fail rates (especially safety checks) and LLM evaluation proxy scores/flags. Compare structured vs. unstructured.
*   **Content Validity:** Measured by LLM evaluation proxy scores (relevance, accuracy, alignment) and specific validation stage results (e.g., content accuracy check).
*   **Efficiency:** Measured by execution time (latency, tokens/sec), memory usage (peak/avg RAM/VRAM), potentially CPU/GPU utilization under simulated constraints. Compare across models, hardware, prompting styles, validation methods.
*   **Robustness (Basic):** Assessed by consistency of performance/quality across different test cases within a suite under the same conditions.
*   **Teacher Satisfaction (Proxy):** Inferred *indirectly* from LLM evaluation scores on usability/clarity aspects, acknowledging this is a weak proxy for Phase 1.

### 7. Data Mapping to Paper Evaluation Criteria

This section explicitly maps the outputs of this specification to the evaluation needs stated in the EdgePrompt paper (Syah et al.).

**7.1 Data for Evaluation Metrics (Paper Sec 2.1.1):**

*   **Content Validity:**
    *   *Source:* LLM Evaluation Proxy results (`evaluation_proxy_result.overall_score`, `criteria_scores`) from Test Suite 4.3 & 4.5 runs. Scores from content-related stages in `validation_result` (Test Suite 4.4).
    *   *Data:* Quantitative scores comparing structured vs. unstructured prompts; validation stage pass rates for content checks.
*   **Safety and Appropriateness:**
    *   *Source:* Pass/fail status of safety stages in `validation_result` (Test Suite 4.4). LLM Evaluation Proxy safety scores/flags (`evaluation_proxy_result.is_safe`) from Test Suite 4.3 runs.
    *   *Data:* Violation rates (structured vs. unstructured), pass rates for safety validation stages.
*   **Efficiency:**
    *   *Source:* `metrics` field within `generation_result` and `validation_result` across all test suites (4.3, 4.4, 4.5), collected by `MetricsCollector`.
    *   *Data:* Execution time (ms), memory usage (MB), tokens/sec, validation stages/sec. Comparisons across hardware profiles, models, prompting styles, validation methods.
*   **Teacher Satisfaction (Simulated Proxy):**
    *   *Source:* LLM Evaluation Proxy results (`evaluation_proxy_result.feedback`, potentially specific criteria scores related to clarity/usability if designed into the eval prompt) from Test Suite 4.3 & 4.5.
    *   *Data:* Qualitative feedback trends, proxy scores (report with caveats about proxy limitation).
*   **Robustness (Basic Phase 1):**
    *   *Source:* Aggregated results across different `test_cases` within suites 4.3, 4.4, 4.5. Standard deviation of performance/quality metrics across runs with same config but different inputs.
    *   *Data:* Consistency metrics (e.g., std dev of scores/latency), pass/fail rate consistency across similar tasks.

**7.2 Data for Validation Approach (Paper Sec 3.3):**

*   **Functional Metrics (Guardrail Effectiveness):**
    *   *Source:* Test Suite 4.3 (Structured vs. Unstructured) & 4.4 (Multi-Stage Validation) results.
    *   *Data:* Valid response ratios (`validation_result.isValid` = true rates), offline stability (successful completion rates under simulated constraints), operational reliability (error rates during orchestration). Comparison data showing benefits of structured prompts and multi-stage validation.
*   **Performance Analysis (Edge Capabilities):**
    *   *Source:* Test Suite 4.5 results and efficiency metrics from all suites.
    *   *Data:* Detailed resource utilization plots/tables across hardware profiles (Fig/Table Paper_HardwarePerformance), model size impact analysis (Fig/Table Paper_ModelSizeImpact), proxy quality vs. resource plots (Fig Paper_QualityResourceTradeoff).
*   **System Validation (SPADE-Inspired Metrics):**
    *   *Source:* Safety/Appropriateness data from Test Suites 4.3 & 4.4.
    *   *Data:* Report relevant metrics like safety violation detection rates, constraint adherence rates, aligning with SPADE's focus but generated via EdgePrompt's prompt-only method.

### 8. Phase 1 Deliverables & Next Steps

*   **Deliverables:**
    *   JSONL files containing raw results for each test suite run.
    *   Generated visualizations (plots) and tables as defined in `analysis_targets`.
    *   Summary statistics and analysis report comparing different conditions (structured vs. unstructured, multi-stage vs. baseline, model sizes, hardware profiles).
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Integrate Phase 1 findings (data, plots, tables, analysis) into the Results section of the EdgePrompt paper (Syah et al.).
    *   Use insights gained (e.g., bottlenecks, effectiveness of specific validation stages, simulation limitations) to refine the plan and priorities for Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Future Development and Extended Validation

**(Goal: Build upon Phase 1 and the paper's vision towards a more robust, adaptable, and production-ready EdgePrompt system. This section outlines the roadmap and provides context.)**

### 9. Phase 2 Vision & Goals

*   Implement and evaluate the Teacher Review System components ($D, T, K$) for identifying edge cases and tracking patterns.
*   Implement and evaluate System Adaptation mechanisms ($A, O, P$) for automated refinement of prompts, rubrics, or validation sequences based on performance history.
*   Conduct performance and functional validation on **actual edge hardware** (Jetson Nano, Orin Nano, etc.) to compare against simulation results.
*   Perform **human-centric evaluations** involving K-12 educators to assess real-world usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction, replacing the LLM proxy evaluation.
*   Enhance robustness by testing against a wider range of **edge cases** and potential **adversarial inputs** (e.g., prompt injection techniques).
*   Refine core algorithms for improved efficiency, accuracy, and simulation fidelity.
*   Potentially explore deeper neural-symbolic integrations if Phase 1 results indicate limitations of the current approach.

### 10. Potential Architectural Extensions (Phase 2)

*   Introduce a **Feedback Database** to store evaluation results (human or LLM proxy) and performance history ($h$).
*   Add an **Adaptation Engine** component that uses data from the Feedback Database to suggest or automatically apply changes to the Template Repository (implementing $A, O, P$).
*   Develop a simple **Teacher Review Interface** (Web UI or CLI tool) to present flagged responses ($T(d)$) and gather explicit feedback.
*   Integrate deployment tools for packaging and running the system on actual edge devices.
*   Enhance the **Hardware Simulator** for greater fidelity based on comparisons with real hardware testing.

### 11. Additional Algorithms & Refinements (Phase 2)

*   **System Adaptation Algorithms:** Logic for $A: R' \rightarrow R''$ (Rubric Adjustment), $O(K, \epsilon)$ (Criteria Optimization based on history $K$), and $P(T_c, h)$ (Template Refinement). Could range from simple rule-based adjustments to more complex ML-based tuning.
*   **Edge Case Detection Algorithm ($D(r, \theta)$):** Logic to flag responses based on low confidence scores from validation stages, unusual patterns, or divergence from expected norms.
*   **Human Feedback Processing:** Algorithms to aggregate and analyze qualitative and quantitative feedback from teachers.
*   **Adversarial Testing Framework:** Implementations or integrations of tools to automatically generate adversarial prompts (e.g., based on techniques like GCG, PAIR, referenced in Dong et al. survey) to test guardrail robustness.
*   **Advanced Optimization:** Explore more sophisticated token efficiency techniques (constraint consolidation based on semantics), KV cache optimization strategies specific to edge models, operation fusion if framework allows.

### 12. New/Extended Schemas (Phase 2)

*   **Human Feedback Schema:** Structure for storing teacher evaluations, comments, and ratings.
*   **Adaptation Rule Schema:** Format for defining rules or parameters used by the Adaptation Engine.
*   **Performance History Schema:** Structure for storing aggregated performance trends ($K(h)$) used for adaptation.
*   Potential extensions to Validation Stage schema to support more complex logic or feedback types.

### 13. New Test Suite Specifications (Phase 2)

*   **Teacher Review Simulation/Human Evaluation Suite:** Test cases presenting flagged outputs to simulated or real teachers via the review interface, measuring review accuracy and time.
*   **System Adaptation Test Suite:** Test cases running the system over multiple iterations with simulated feedback, measuring if adaptation mechanisms improve metrics (e.g., reduce safety violations, increase content validity scores).
*   **Real Hardware Benchmarking Suite:** Re-running key performance tests from Suite 4.5 on actual target edge devices (Jetson Nano, Orin Nano) and comparing results to simulation.
*   **Adversarial Robustness Test Suite:** Applying automated adversarial prompt generation techniques (e.g., targeting safety or relevance stages) and measuring the success rate of bypassing guardrails.
*   **Longitudinal/Scalability Test Suite:** Simulating sustained use over time, testing for performance degradation, memory leaks, or issues with larger contexts / longer interactions.

### 14. Extended Evaluation Criteria (Phase 2)

*   **Direct Human Teacher Satisfaction:** Scores from surveys or usability testing with target educators.
*   **Usability Metrics:** Task completion rates, error rates, time-on-task for teachers using review/generation features.
*   **Adaptation Effectiveness:** Quantifiable improvement in Phase 1 metrics over time due to automated adaptation.
*   **Real Hardware Performance:** Measured latency, throughput, power consumption, thermal behavior on actual edge devices.
*   **Simulation Fidelity Score:** Quantitative comparison of simulation vs. real hardware results.
*   **Robustness Score:** Success rate of guardrails against specific categories of adversarial attacks.

### 15. Phase 2 Execution Strategy & Next Steps

*   Prioritize Phase 2 activities based on Phase 1 findings (e.g., if simulation was inaccurate, prioritize real hardware testing; if specific validation stages were weak, prioritize adaptation/refinement).
*   Develop iteratively, potentially starting with real hardware validation and human evaluation proxies before full adaptation loops.
*   Engage with target users (Indonesian K-12 educators/stakeholders) for feedback and potential pilot studies (requires ethical review and planning).
*   Develop deployment packages and documentation for real-world trials.
*   Establish processes for ongoing monitoring, feedback collection, and continuous improvement post-deployment.
