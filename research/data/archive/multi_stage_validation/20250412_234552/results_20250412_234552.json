The score reflects the thoroughness of the feedback provided.\nvocabulary_check: The feedback correctly identifies that the answer (which was 'I don\u2019t know') is insufficient for a Grade 5 student. However, the language used in the feedback itself \u2013 terms like \u2018biodiversity,\u2019 \u2018climate regulation,\u2019 and \u2018ecosystems\u2019 \u2013 might be slightly advanced for some 10-11 year olds. While these concepts are introduced at this level, using them explicitly in the *feedback* could create a barrier to understanding.  A more accessible phrasing would have been better. The score reflects that the core concept of needing a description is understood, but the feedback's vocabulary needs adjustment for Grade 5 comprehension.\n"
